# Handle-Sign-Tool-JS-Script-for-Illustrator

I am a font designer and for the presentation of letters I often need to show how handles and anchors are located. I wrote a JS script for Illustrator that completely automates this process. At startup, it is possible to adjust the size of handles and anchors, as well as the stroke width

How to work with the script:

1. Place the script file in Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 2023\Presets\en_GB\Scripts
2. Select the rectangles in the Illustrator file
2. Click File -> Scripts -> Anchors

You can improve:

1. Now the script draws all the symbols in blue by default. You can add a field for entering the user's color
